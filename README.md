# Neovim Runtime Configuration

For Ramith Jayatilleka's personal use. Feel free to copy.

All runtime configuration is modularized into different files and sourced in
`init.vim`. For a decent set of defaults, I recommend disabling the `windows`
module as well as all plugins.

### Todo

- Add easy-align
- Add YouCompleteMe
- Add framework to autoload
- Add checks on loads
