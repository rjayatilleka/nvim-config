# Neovim Runtime Configuration

For Ramith Jayatilleka's personal use. Feel free to copy.

All runtime configuration is modularized into different files and sourced in
`init.vim`. For a decent set of defaults, I recommend turning off the modules
`windows`, `plugin_initialization`, and `plugin_customization`.
